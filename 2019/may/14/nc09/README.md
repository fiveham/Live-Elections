# Live-Elections
This is where live election result updates from the NCSBE (and any other similar sources) will be uploaded to get around a lack of CORS so that maps in Elections can update live.

This requires running a script to download the results as they come in and push them to Github.

The downloading script is already made, but programmatically pushing to Github is still being explored.
